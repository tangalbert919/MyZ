# MyZ Reborn

This is MyZ Reborn, a Minecraft plugin that continues the work of [Jordan Sicherman](https://www.github.com/JordanSicherman)'s [MyZ](https://www.github.com/JordanSicherman/MyZ) plugin.

MyZ offically supports Minecraft 1.7.9-1.8.1. Only this fork has support for Minecraft 1.8.3 and up.

This fork is focused on maintaining compatibility with later versions of Minecraft. Anything before Minecraft 1.7.9 won't get support due to their age (and nobody really plays on Minecraft 1.7-1.7.8 anymore).
