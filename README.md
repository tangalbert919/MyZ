# MyZ Reborn

This is MyZ Reborn, a Minecraft plugin that continues the work of [Jordan Sicherman](https://www.github.com/JordanSicherman)'s [MyZ](https://www.github.com/JordanSicherman/MyZ) plugin.

The last version of MyZ supports Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.8.8.

MyZ Reborn requires Minecraft 1.9 or above in order to prevent conflicts and keep the size of the plugin small.

This fork is focused on maintaining compatibility with later versions of Minecraft. Anything before Minecraft 1.7.9 won't get support due to their age (and nobody really plays on Minecraft 1.7-1.7.8 anymore).
